===============

Teraball! An arcade style game.

===============
This game asks the player to navigate a ball through a hazardous maze in order to get to the level exit quickly.
The ball has momentum and can richochet off walls. Mastering the ball's movement is critical.

===============
KNOWN BUGS:
Saving/writing to file using the map editor entirely fails to function, an empty file results.

===============
TODO:
HIGH PRIORITY - 
Add a functioning preferences / scores panel to the front end.
Add a "how to play" option to the front end.
Continue towards building a functional (and eventually fully featured) map editor.
MEDIUM PRIORITY -
Add more commenting / docs to many of the 'building block' classes within the backend
LOW PRIORITY -
Make the front end UI not completly hideous.
Think up new map elements for more complex / interesting gameplay on later levels.
